title: "Buttons Are a Hack"

## The New Rules of Designing for Touch ##

- [Fitts' Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law) applies just as much to the finger just as much as it does an external pointing device.
- The Designer's Mantra: Let people be lazy.
- Gestures are the keyboard shortcuts of touch: abstract, not entirely obvious, and for advanced users.
- Lightswitches: an inspired hack. The lightswitch is a middle man between you and turning on that light.
- With touch, we create the illusion that there is no illusion. That the user is directly interacting with the behind-the-scenes magic.

## Whither the Web? ##

- JavaScript support is very limited: `touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchend`. No swipe, pinch, or multi-touch gestures.
- How to create [Windows 8 start screen tiles](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsappdev/archive/2012/04/16/creating-a-great-tile-experience-part-1.aspx).
- [An overview of coding multitouch for the Web](https://twitter.com/globalmoxie/status/232865943020249089)
- [Web gestures must sidestep built-in gestures in browser and OS.](https://twitter.com/globalmoxie/status/232866222289596416)
- [LukeW](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1441): "The Web browser is inside of every application instead of every application being inside the Web browser."

## Interesting Application Interactions ##

- [Adobe Proto](http://www.adobe.com/products/proto.html): a touch app offering quick wireframing with gestures that borrow from sketch shorthand.
- The [Clear app](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/) was inspired by games and instruments.
- [TouchUp app](http://www.roguesheep.com/touchup.html) doesn't do brush sizes. Instead, you zoom in on the canvas and the brush size remains the same relative to the size of your finger.

## Finding What You Can't See ##

- Rely on the accumulated knowledge of interacting with the Web to inform developing new touch-based interfaces.
- Muscle memory is [much faster than visual memory](https://twitter.com/globalmoxie/status/232869723858153472).
- [The OCD Chef cutting board](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/e7a8/)
- Don Norman's "[Living with Complexity](http://www.amazon.com/Living-Complexity-Donald-Norman/dp/0262014866/)": taming complexity by minimizing complication
- We're moving toward a world where the medium is no longer the message but _the message is the medium_. Content is the control. Think: photo-based apps with wall-of-photos designs.
- Sydney Morning Herald iPad app pagination: hold on a dot and you're shown a list of links to articles on available on that page.

Video games use these techniques to teach:

1. **Coaching:** Create an environment where the first interaction is a success.
2. **Leveling Up:** Introduce one element as a time and encourage users to learn as they go.
3. **Power Ups:** Offer rewards for power users.
