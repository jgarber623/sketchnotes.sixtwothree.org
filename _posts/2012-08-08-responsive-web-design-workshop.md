> We must accept the ebb and flow of things.

- [Interactive Architecture](http://www.interactive-architecture.com/) by Michael Fox & Miles Kemp

- Example: [Andersson-Wise Architects](http://www.anderssonwise.com/)
- Example: [AIDS.gov](http://aids.gov/), the first American government site to launch with a respnosive web design
- [BBC's responsive news experiments](http://responsivenews.co.uk/news)
- On People Magazine's new [mobile-specific site](http://m.people.com/): The decision was made to spend more up-front time/money/effort on building a responsive site as it would save time/money/effort in the long term. The end goal is to slowly roll this design out to more and more devices.
- **Do not define breakpoints upfront.** Instead, start with content and content heirarchy.
- When designing responsively, get out of Photoshop as early as you feel you can.
- Kevin Hoffman: "Sketch mobile first, then adapt from there."
- Brad Frost's [Test on real mobile devices without breaking the bank](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/mobile/test-on-real-mobile-devices-without-breaking-the-bank/)
- Mobile Portland's [Device Lab](http://mobileportland.com/content/device-lab-update-creating-non-profit-setting-board-and-moving-forward)
- Mobile first **and** Content first: ensure that each piece of content has the right to be on the page.
