title: 'Mind the Gap: Designing in the Space Between Devices'
---

Presented by [Josh Clark](http://globalmoxie.com/).

- We've gotten very good at bridging gaps online. Information flows freely around the world.
- How do we deal with these physical gaps between our devices?
- 90% of people who have more than one device accomplish tasks across multiple screens
- [RCA's wireless remote controlled television](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opExA1y1xAg) from 1961


## Sequential Tasks

- Apple's [Continuity](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/continuity/) feature closes the gaps between devices.
- [Google's Deep Shot](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/37153.pdf) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGTM6xs2sck)) is one attempt at migrating tasks across devices in a sequential way.


## Simultaneous Tasks

- Google's [Racer](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/racer/?f=) Chrome Experiment
- [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/), peer-to-peer, web sockets without the server in the middle.

> It's not enough to share content across devices. We need to share action. We want to sync verbs, not just nouns.

- Building blocks: Web Sockets, WebRTC, Bluetooth LE
- Boris Smus' [ultrasonic networking](http://smus.com/ultrasonic-networking/) and [sonicnet.js](https://github.com/borismus/sonicnet.js)


## Physical Interaction

- Interacting with gadgets in ways that are more natural and more in line with how we interact with the physical world.
- [DrumPants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VS2jWqFKM0)
- [Misfit Shine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmUOczrb9J4) has you place the device on your smartphone screen to sync. This accommodates shortcomings in the physical design (made of aluminum) that inhibited long-distance Bluetooth communciation.

> We need to make our devices more social.

- [Happy Together app](https://vimeo.com/86287024), source code available [on GitHub](https://github.com/houseoflegend/happytogether)
- Aral Balkan's The Boat That Hacked [screen grabbing hack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYveEdhTgBs)

> It's not a challenge of technology. It's a challenge of imagination.

- New kinds of input devices: [Myo](https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/) armband, Logbar's [Ring](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1761670738/ring-shortcut-everything), and [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/)

> Never try to out-mouse the mouse

- How do we use new inputs to talk to devices? What can we do that the mouse can't do?
- The Leap Motion can point at stuff that's not on the screen, bridging the gap between physical and digital.

## Physical and Digital

- [Rom's interactive Leap Motion Displays](https://www.leapmotion.com/blog/3-questions-roms-interactive-led-displays/)
- Use devices to pull up information about garments in real time in a retail context. Bringing the online shopping experience to the physical shopping experience.
- [The Internet of Things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things): digital becomes physical and physical becomes digital
- [The Mimo Baby Monitor](http://mimobaby.com/mimo/) is either creepy or amazing. Gives a digital avatar to a newborn.
- [Mundane Computing](https://bdconf.com/podcasts/mundane-computing-with-josh-clark/): trivial improvements to devices (e.g. a WiFi-enabled microwave that simply keeps the time correct)
- [Teddy Ruxpin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Ruxpin) was an attempt at a social toy, but failed due to the limitations of available technology. Now, we can have truly social toys like those available from [Toymail](http://www.toymail.co/).
- _Software makes hardware scale._ Teddy Ruxpin was limited to the available cassettes. Software lets hardware be an avatar for people. Software scales the lifespan and durability of the hardware.
- [LG HomeChat](http://lgusblog.com/product-news/lg-homechat-makes-easy-communicate-smart-appliances/)

> Software is ideology, embedded with values. It's political (in terms of worldview).

- Honor intention, but don't assume it. We often confuse context with intention. They aren't the same!
- Intentional, Passive, and Social Interactions: The key is to successfully combine all three.

> Amplify human connection. Bend technology to our lives and not the reverse.


## Designing for the Future

- Plan for gadget hopping in your service. Know that 2/3rds of your shoppers will complete the task across devices.
- Share action and tasks across devices.
- Lean on peer-to-peer sharing. Sometimes you don't need the network.
- Move interactions off the screen and into the world around us.
- Design for sensors and use them as the interface.
- Everything can have an avatar, a digital representation for us to manipulate. We can have a semi-social relationship with our devices, appliances, etc.
