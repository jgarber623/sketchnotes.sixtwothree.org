## Growing Up

- A total child of the '80s: G.I. Joe, Transformers, Pro Wrestling, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
- Drew obsessively growing up
- Has $7000 worth of Canadian community college education

## Signalnoise

- Run out of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia in an extra bedroom at home

> The greatest thing about that '80s is that it was equal parts awesome and ridiculous.

- Purple Rain, Masters of the Universe

## Highs and Lows

- Developed a particular style, but grew bored with it since every client wanted fundamentally the same thing.
- Created a faux sticker series, still influenced by the '80s and Pop Culture, but in a different visual style.
- Designed a series of patches for various NASA missions and projects. Started sharing the work around online.
- National Film Board of Canada gets in touch asking for help about designing a program to get kids interested in space exploration.

> You never know where your work is going to show up unless you put it out there.

- You need to know when to pull the plug when things aren't working.
- [The StarKade Series](http://blog.signalnoise.com/starkade-series/)

> Never overlook a silly idea.

## Case Study

- [Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry_3:_Blood_Dragon)

> If you're given any sort of creative freedom, attack it with a vengeance.

## Lessons

- Everyone makes it up as they go.
