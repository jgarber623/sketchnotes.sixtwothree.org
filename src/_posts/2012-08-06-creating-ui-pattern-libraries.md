title: "Creating UI Pattern Libraries"
---

Presented by [Sarah Parmenter](http://www.sazzy.co.uk/).

- Rebranded! "The Responsive Workflow"
- Responsive design is like a never-ending piece of art. It's always evolving.
- Read Luke Wroblewski's "[Mobile First](http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first/)" already!
- 2015: Mobile and Desktop usage collide!
- [Trent Walton](http://trentwalton.com/2012/02/02/redefined/): "To think about the web responsively is to think about the web in proportions, not pixels.""
- [Aptus](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aptus/id510487565?mt=12): screenshot your responsive designs at different breakpoints.

## Sarah's Workflow ##

1. [Structure](#structure)
2. [Content](#content)
3. [Typography](#typography)
4. [Mood board](#mood-board)
5. [UI Pattern Library](#ui-pattern-library)
6. [Asset Management](#asset-management)
7. [Native considerations](#native-considerations)

### Structure ###

- 65% of designers say they work to common breakpoints.
- [Mark Boulton](http://www.markboulton.co.uk/): "You can create good experiences without knowing the content. You can't create good experiences without content structure."
- [Gridset](http://gridsetapp.com/), by Mark Boulton, for creating custom grids.
- [Gridpak](http://gridpak.com/), a responsive grid generator.
- [Crazyegg](http://www.crazyegg.com/) heatmapping service.

### Content ###

- Time to let go of using _lorem ipsum_ in our designs.
- Traffic light system for identifying important content. Color-coding content green, yellow, or red. Green content for all devices/experiences. Yellow for context-specific content. Red for content that may not be entirely necessary or useful.
- [Voice & Tone](http://voiceandtone.com/)

### Typography ###

- [Typecast](http://beta.typecastapp.com/) for laying things out quickly and pairing webfonts. Exports CSS.
- [Village](http://vllg.com/)
- [YouWorkForThem](http://www.youworkforthem.com/)

### Mood board ###

- [styletil.es](http://styletil.es/)
- Pinterest can be a good source for imagery for mood boards.
- [Andy Clarke](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/): "Static visuals are the currency of the web."

### UI Pattern Library ###

- Using recurring interface elements builds a library of solutions to repeating problems. Think: three-line menu button on iOS, pull-to-refresh on iOS.
- [UI Patterns design patterns](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/)
- [Mobile UI Patterns](http://mobile-patterns.com/)
- Static visuals (designing a comp for every page) are dying. Pattern libraries are the future.
- [Reeoo](http://reeoo.com/), a web design inspiration gallery.
- [Photoshop CSS3 plugin](http://css3ps.com/)
- [CSS3Toolkit](http://css3toolkit.com/)
- [Starbucks' pattern library and style guide](http://www.starbucks.com/static/reference/styleguide/)

### Asset Management ###

- [Slicy (n√©e Layer Cake)](http://macrabbit.com/slicy/) for busting out design elements/assets from a PSD by layers/groups. Would be very useful for a pattern library full of buttons and other similar UI patterns. Automatically create retina-ready graphics by adding +@2x to end of filename.

### Native considerations ###

- Touch guidelines: 45-47px averge index finger, 72px average thumb size when used on a touch device.
- When designing, keep a set of overlays at 44px x 44px touch size to see if hit areas overlap. If so, adjust your design.
- When developing for mobile, don't forget about `border-image` for creating assets.
- OS cross-contamination: design patterns on iOS do not translate to Android do not translate to Blackberry, etc.
- Use Automator to add @2x to a bunch of filenames.
- [Brad Frost](http://bradfrostweb.com/): "This is web design not religion."
