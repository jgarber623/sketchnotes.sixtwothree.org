- Lettering is _drawing_. Calligraphy is _writing_.
- Higher x-height makes type easier to read at smaller sizes.
- Don't ever set your kerning to zero in Photoshop. Use "auto" or "metrics."

## Choosing Typefaces ##

- Look to your content to help you make decisions about type.
- What kind of content is most prevalent on your site? Choose the typeface that will appear most frequently on your site and satisfies the needs of that content.
- When selecting a typeface, look for:
	- Higher x-height
	- Low contrast
	- Excellent spacing
	- Number of weights/available optical sizes
	- A true italic (no [sloped romans](https://twitter.com/jgarber/status/232510386912514048)!
	- Real small caps
- What feeling does the content communicate?
- How experimental can you get with new tech? How many of your audience use outdated browsers and how much do you care to cater to them?
- Pairing typefaces: choose typefaces with similar DNA.
