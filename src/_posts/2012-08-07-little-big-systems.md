- [Little Big Planet](http://www.littlebigplanet.com/) is the marriage of Systems and Craft.
- Content Strategy is system design.

## Making Systems ##

- A system is an interlocking set of problems.
- Christopher Alexander's [A Pattern Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language)
- All big projects are ultimately systems (content management systems, most "software", social networks); they are an interdependent set of features/problems.

## Bringing Craft to Systems ##

There's tremendous value in focusing on workmanship and mastering one's craft. Systems need craft.

The five principles of craft:

1. [Learn Your Artifact](#learn-your-artifact)
2. [Make For Makers](#make-for-makers)
3. [Take The Time](#take-the-time)
4. [Ship Small, But Excellent](#ship-small-but-excellent)
5. [Seek Deep Knowledge](#seek-deep-knowledge)

### Learn Your Artifact ###

- Japanese [wagashi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagashi) are made by artisans who only make these craft confections.
- Contrast these with [NestlÃ© Aero bars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aero_(chocolate)): factory-made, mass-produced.
- We must establish an intimate knowledge of our artifacts.
- Famous woodworker and furniture maker [James Krenov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Krenov) understood intimately how to build systems that worked in many climates and seasons:

> A true achievement is to make a fine cabinet&mdash;elegant, graceful, one with real character&mdash;and fit it with drawers and doors that work properly the year round.

- Craft and workmanship come from a genuine understanding of the artifact.
- James Krenov: "The craftsman works, looking and looking again, from one revelation to another."

### Make For Makers ###

- [Mast Brothers Chocolate](http://mastbrothers.com/): New York-based chocolatiers who spend three months every year in South America working on cocoa plantations.
- 54 million active Wordpress installations worldwide.
- We have unintentionally been making systems that strangle excellence. Think: horrible, horrible CMSes.
- When we fail to make for the makers, we are making it that much more difficult for them to serve the end users.
- Create content systems built around workflow.
- [Voice & Tone](http://voiceandtone.com/) is a tool absolutely created for makers. **Dig through this site.**

### Take The Time ###

- Big projects suck because of time: teams rotate in or out, feels like nothing really gets done, or there's not enough time to complete the project. The process is either too long or too short: never _just right_.
- **Craft requires time:** [The Enchanted Doll](http://www.enchanteddoll.com/) by Marina Bychkova take 350-500 hours to complete _each_ doll.
- Craft requires more than talent or skill: **it requires time**.
- **Craft is time-travel:** take future problems that are risky in ways you can't understand and deal with them in a controlled space. Move troubles forward in time so that we can deal with them.
- It seems more costly to take more time, but in the end it's that you can't afford _not to take the time_.
- **Time must be won:** Excellent project management is the single most important factor in running a successful project.
- Don't say "No," but say, "No, but what I can do is this..." We can work on something smaller and take the time to get it right.
- James Krenov: "What did the doing take, and what did it give?"
- At the end of every project, what did the doing take out of you and what did it give to you and to the people using it?

### Ship Small, But Excellent ###

- Work from large to small. Ship small to large.
- Do as little as you can in your work and in your process. Don't do things for the sake of doing things.
- Work small and build on your sucesses. Narrow the scope.

> It's better to get a sub-system right than to work on a whole system and get it wrong.

### Seek Deep Knowledge ###

Reinvent only with reason. Charles and Ray Eames:

> Innovate as a last resort.

- Patrizio Bertelli, Prada CEO: "Young people are not necessarily the key to innovation"
- Uncover institutional knowledge and find the old hands. Do apprenticeships! Take on apprentices!

Dear Sugar (Cheryl Strayed):

> You don't have a career. You have a life. Do the work.
