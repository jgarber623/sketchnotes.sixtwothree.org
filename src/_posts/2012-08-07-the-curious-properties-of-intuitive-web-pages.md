- Tells us things about our users.
- At the bottom of the escalator: someone with no knowledge of the design.
- At the top of the esdcalator: someone with encyclopedic knowledge of the design.
- Current Knowledge: the knowledge someone has at the onset of a task.
- Target Knowledge: the knowledge needed to complete a task at the time of the task's completion.
- The space between Current Knowledge and Target Knowledge is the Knowledge Gap.
- Socially-Transmitted Functionality: things you learn from socially-shared knowledge (Twitter's pull-to-refresh).
- The amazing [Umbrella Today?](http://umbrellatoday.com/) simplifies (brings Target Knowledge down to Current Knowledge). That's intuitive.
- Intuitive: _What I Know_ matches _What I Need To Know_
- Redesigns often destroy users' Current Knowledge.

- When you remove the requirement of quality, everything becomes much easier.
- Intuitive design is how we give our users new superpowers.
- The most important users need the most intuitive designs.
