- [Digital Equipment Corporation's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation) [PDP 8E](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-8): The world's first mini-computer.
- By 1988, DEC was the second largest computer company, behind IBM.
- Ken Olsen, DEC CEO: "There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home."

The lie we tell ourselves today: "There is no reason anyone would want to do that on mobile."

## Disruptive Innovation ##

- New innovations come along and they don't perform nearly as well as previous devices (may be less powerful, more expensive) but they create a new market.
- This happens again and again: floppy disk drives, printing (offset printers to laser printers to inkjet printers), photography (film to digital to mobile).
- Current disruption is in personal computers: Mobile phones and devices are opening up the Internet to a whole class of people who have never experienced the Internet.
- Clayton Christensen was way wrong about the iPhone. He saw it as a fancy cell phone.

## The Digital Divide ##

- 20% of Americans have no Internet access at all.
- 35% have no Internet access at home. These people may want to have access to the Internet, but may be limited to locked-down networks at work.
- 29% of Black Americans have no Internet access.
- 32% of Hispanic Americans have no Internet access.
- 57% of Americans with no high school diploma have no Internet access.
- 46% of Americans with a disability have no Internet access.
- 88% of Americans own a mobile phone.
- 55% of Americans use their mobile phone to access the Internet. Between 2009 and 2012, mobile Internet use increased from 31%. This coincides with the rise in smartphones and are most frequently purchased by disadvantaged groups (Black, Hispanic, and Asian Americans).

## The "Mobile Mostly" User ##

- 31% of all Americans only or mostly use the Internet on their mobile phones. That amounts to **50 million Americans**. How much time have you spent concerning yourself with the 2% of visitors without JavaScript versus this 17% of Americans?
- 51% of Black Americans only or mostly use the Internet on their mobile phones.
- Susannah Fox, Pew Research: "Mobile was the final frontier in the access revolution. It has erased the digital divide."
- For the 31% of Americans who only access the Internet through a mobile phone, we are reminding them that they are second-class citizens.
- Health Care Providers are hurting those that need information the most by not providing a usable mobile experience.

## Digital Government ##

Americans deserve a government that works for them anytime, anywhere, and on any device. The following is a rundown of planks from the government's [Building A 21st Century Platform To Better Serve The American People](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html) initiative.

### Research & Planning ###

The government's plan:

- Within three months, engage with customers to identify the highest priority services to optimize for mobile.
- Within one year, make two key services available on mobile.
- When practical, publish a plan for improving additional existing services as practical.

**That last bullet is incredibly risky** and a recipe for crappy mobile sites that do two things then kick users over to a desktop experience. It ignores a long-term plan. "You have to know the endstate you want" (Gerard Gober, Comcast).

### Adaptive Content ###

Adaptive content is flexible, so it can adapt to different screen sizes, and can be presented in different formats as appropriate for the device.

- 43% of federal agencies do not use a CMS to publish online content.
- Tumblr's publishing information guides you to create chunks of content. This stands in contrast to Wordpress' lack of a structured experience. This approach provides much greater flexibility when presenting structured content on the front end.
- **Create presentation-independent content.** When you are thinking about creating your content, you are not imagining that it will live on one and only one platform.
- Treat content as a service. The government should be figuring out how to make its information available. Think how the government's release of GPS and weather data has fueled billion-dollar industries.
- NPR's Open Content and APIs system is a wonderful example of how structured content and APIs can make publishing across a large variety of platforms work.

### Writing & Editing ###

> There is no such thing as writing for mobile; **there is just good writing**.

- Mobile is a catalyst for getting organizations to re-imagine their content and clean it up.
- Great content transcends platform.
- David Balcom, American Cancer Society: "We felt it was a life-saving imperitive to have all of our content on mobile."
- Even if you don't have a mobile site or strategy, writing and editing your website's content now will help prepare you for that day.

### Mobile Governance ###

- You cannot have a mobile team that is separate from your desktop team. That will only create divisions that will be reflected in your mobile and desktop offerings.
- Disruptive technologies eventually do good or they redefine what good is. The benefit of the transistor radio was its portability. That made it worth the trade-off in sound quality compared to large home radios.
- Do mobile right and **do it right from the start**.

> I want us to ask ourselves every day, how are we using technology to make a real difference in people's lives?
