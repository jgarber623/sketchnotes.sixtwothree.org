---

Presented by [Steve Wendel](http://www.hellowallet.com/), author of [Designing for Behavior Change](http://bit.ly/changebehavior) and organizer of [Action Design DC](http://www.meetup.com/Action-Design-DC/).

## The Five Stages of Processing Before Users Act

- Conscious actions pass through a number of stages before execution: cue, reaction, evaluation, ability, and timeliness.
- All five of these actions must occur at the same time.
- No one wants to retire poor, yet we don’t save.

### Step 1: Detect a Cue

- The buzz of a cell phone. No one stares at their phone and waits for a TXT message.
- Does your application appropriately cue users?

### Step 2: React Intuitively, Emotionally

- We have an immediate, intuitive reaction to cues. We can’t help this.
- HelloWallet presents budgeting as a “Wellness Score.”

### Step 3: Conscious Evaluation

- What are the costs and benefits associated with taking this action?

### Step 4: Ability

- Does the user know what to do? Can they do it? Do they believe they can succeed?
- 500px’s iOS app onboarding process explains the basics of the app to new users.

### Step 5: Timeliness

> Jim Rohn: “Without a sense of urgency, desire loses it’s value.”

- Is the action urgent? Is it urgent relative to other external factors that may require action?
- The Washington Post’s homepage relies on inherent urgency. News stories tend to disappear over time.
- Twitter created inherent urgency. Tweets remain available but the sense is that they won’t be.


## Exercise

[Techcrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/) has built a strong cue between themselves and technology news. Someone mentions a new tech gadget, your brain immediately thinks to visit Techcrunch’s website. News websites prey on user’s Fear of Missing Out.

The benefit is knowledge, being a part of hype, exclusivity. The cost is time. Benefit generally outweighs the cost.

> The five steps are a checklist for a product.


## How to Improve Your Users’ Likelihood of Voluntary Action

- The actions are a funnel, starting with the cue.

> CREATE: Cue, Reaction, Evaluation, Ability, Time Pressure, Execute Action

- A user could bail at any of these steps for various reasons.
- Knowing where your product goes wrong at any of these steps is key.

### Three Strategies to Pass the Funnel

1. Conscious choice.
2. Build a habit through simple repetition.
3. Cheat. Shift the burden of work from the individual to the product.

#### Cheating

In the financial world, auto-enrollment in services is one of the most popular way to cheat. The power of defaulting.

### Step 1: How to Cue

- Get in people’s line of sight.
- Become part of the environment.
- Become part of routines.
- Hook into stuff people already attend to.
- Avoid crowded places (like email).

### Step 2: Pass the Emotional Test

- Don’t be ugly. Don’t make a painful, ugly product. [Medium](http://www.medium.com/) feels like a newspaper, not a “crappy old blog.” Hook into things people already love.
- Tailor to the user’s prior experiences.

### Step 3: Provide Value

### Step 4: How to Pass the Ability Test

- Show them how.
- Make them confident.
- Or, cheat.

### Step 5: How to Pass the Timeliness Test

- Make it urgent. (e.g. The Rolly Clock)
- Make it specific.
- Ask users to pre-commit.

> Specificity has a power that vagueness doesn’t.
