- Design is problem-solving. Create according to a plan. This is why we should design systems, not pages.
- Think about content _and_ context. How are people consuming the content?

## Style tiles…

- Separate style from structure.
- Isolate the risk in subjectivity.
- Is device-width agnostic.
- Serve as a cornerstone that an entire team can rally around.

Defined: A design deliverable consisting of fonts, color, and interface elements.

## How to use Style Tiles

### Listen

- Hold a design kickoff meeting with all stakelholders.
- Ask as many questions as you can. Do less talking and more listening.
- Ask what the top three user goals are. The top three business goals?
- Generate a definition of success that is separate from taste.
- Who is the audience? Who are your competitors?
- Ask degree questions: “On a scale from 1 to 5…”

### Interpret

- Narrow down survey results and question responses.
- Aggregate adjectives from the answers and group into several buckets (e.g. Same, Middle, and Different relative to current design).
- Break down the big ideas into smaller pieces.
- Humans make subconscious assumptions based on subtle visual cues.

### Define A Visual Language

### Iterate

- Iterating on a style is more efficient than iterating on an entire comp.
