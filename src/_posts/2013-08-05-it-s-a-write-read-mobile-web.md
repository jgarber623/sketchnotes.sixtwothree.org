title: It’s a Write/Read (Mobile) Web
---

Presented by [Luke Wroblewski](http://www.lukew.com/).

- Tim Berners-Lee’s original vision for the Web was that it would be a read/write experience.
- The largest destinations on the Internet are based on user’s contributions (e.g. Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, AOL).
- All of these destinations/companies are working to bring their experiences to mobile.

> 60% of all Twitter users are mobile users.

> 40% of views on YouTube are from a mobile device.

- The mobile-only population is the fastest growing on Facebook: 127% in the last year.

> 30% of Indian Facebook users are mobile-only.

> 10,000 cars a week are sold on eBay mobile.

Utility-based apps are increasing in use on mobile. Things like shopping, financial, health, planning, and travel apps.


## One-Handed Use

- [Polar](http://polarb.com/) was designed from the ground up to be used thumbs-only for both content consumption and creation.
- Keyboards and mice are an abstraction between us and software. With mobile, touch-based devices, this abstraction layer is removed and we interact directly with software.

> What we need to do to design is to look at _the extremes_. The middle will take care of itself. — Dan Formosa

- If you can use an app with just a thumb, you can use it with the rest of your fingers.
- 68% of consumer smartphone use is happening at home.
- When designing for one-handed use, try to design in such a way that the device keyboard does not appear (e.g. Google's mobile Flight Search).

## Focused Flows

- [Boingo](http://www.boingo.com/) saw a 53% decrease in sign-up times by eliminating 11 unnecessary input fields.
- [Hotel Tonight](http://www.hoteltonight.com/) takes 8 seconds to book a hotel (3 taps and a swipe).

> It takes big changes to go small.

- Hotel Tonight’s reviews are photographic instead of written.
- In order to get creative, you have to push boundaries.


## Just-In-Time Actions

- On Polar, when making a poll and the keyboard displays, a user’s avatar is swapped with a “Close keyboard” icon.
- Pinterest-style hide/show header/footer on scrolling (also on Google+ mobile).
- **A just-in-time action:** something that’s relevant in the moment and is then hidden when it’s no longer relevant.


## The New Reality of Cross-Device Usage

- There is more than one screen in our lives. 13% of Americans own a laptop, tablet, and smartphone.

### Access

- Seamless movement of content across devices.
- Apps like Chrome remember sessions across devices, including Back-button/history.

### Flow

- Seamless movement of process across devices (e.g. Google Maps)
- eBay keeps track of in-process listings across devices (website and mobile app).
- Google Docs live changes across devices in real time.
- [Google’s Racer Chrome experiment](http://g.co/racer)

### Control

- One device controlling another.
- Old Yahoo! “Projector” login: A phone could scan an image on a computer to verify a login.
- [OneID](https://www.oneid.com/) identity management service to securely log in to services. Similar to [Authy](https://www.authy.com/).

### Push

- One device sending data to another (e.g. AirPlay).
- Chromecast uses same user agent and IP as the controlling device. It also mimics the pixel dimensions of the controlling device.
