title: Ten Commandments of Web Design
---

Presented by [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/).

- This presentation is about ways to find your edge. What makes you great?


## I. Though Shalt Entertain

- [Panic](http://www.panic.com/) establishes tone with their logo and simple, friendly language.
- [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/) uses illustration to add illustration that complements the article and sets tone.

> John Lennon went to art school which is why he can’t draw.

- [rdio](http://rdio.com/) neither entertains nor informs on [their 404 page](http://www.rdio.com/404/).
- [New York Daily News' 404 page](http://www.nydailynews.com/404) is entertaining and informative.
- [Gnu Foods](http://gnufoods.com/) uses wordplay to entertain.


## II. Test Everything

> Different screen size is only the beginning.

- [Remote Preview](http://viljamis.com/blog/2012/remote-preview/) responsive testing tool.
- Testing assumptions: Jeffrey's ALA blog post, [On Alt Text](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/on-alt-text).
- Sometimes genius design might be the best approach. Related: [Looking Beyond User-Centered Design](http://alistapart.com/column/looking-beyond-user-centered-design)


## III. Thou Shalt Iterate

> “I move things around until they look right.” — Milton Glaser

- Iteration makes for great design. This will set your site apart from others.
- As an agency, you should have in your contracts an iteration phase after launching a product.


## IV. Thou Shalt Ship

> If you can’t delegate at the pixel level, you’ll never ship.

- Suggestion: double your rates every time a client refuses to ship because something isn’t perfect.


## V. Engage The Community

- Instagram’s Terms of Service change hurt them in the short term. Flickr gained from this misstep with the launch of their iOS app around the same time.

> Redesigns should never be simply putting a new skin on something.

- A List Apart’s [Embeddable Comments](https://github.com/alistapart/comment-embed)


## VI. Love Thy User As Thyself

- Meet them where they are. Design appropriately for each kind of device.
- Never assume there’s a mobile use case that’s different.


## VII. Remember Thy Content And Keep It Holy

> If you design around breakpoints, it’s breakpointless.

- Mark Boulton’s [A Richer Canvas](http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/a-richer-canvas)
- Content first: Getting the right content to the right user at the right time.
- [Zeldman.com](http://www.zeldman.com/) redesign stripped away everything but the content. Jeffrey wanted to make a webpage with a good lean-back reading experience. [37signal’s blog](http://37signals.com/svn) did a similar thing shortly after.


## VIII. Thou Shalt Make Magic

> Make magic, not perfection.

- Instagram’s [behind-the-scenes processing](https://speakerdeck.com/mikeyk/secrets-to-lightning-fast-mobile-design) makes the app feel faster.


## IX. Thou Shalt Prioritize

- [Kick Ass Kickoff Meetings](http://alistapart.com/article/kick-ass-kickoff-meetings)


## X. To Thine Own Self Be True

> This is design, not religion.
