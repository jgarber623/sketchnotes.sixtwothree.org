> Design is not an endpoint, it’s a stop along the timeline.

**MVU: Minimum Viable Understanding.** What’s the least amount of work that can be done to effectively convey an idea?

> Good design happens around good constraints.


## The Nimble Process

- Start with paper. It’s cheap: actually and mentally. Don’t worry about fidelity.
- _Ideas want to be ugly._ Ideas can be ugly because they are cheap and quick.

> Sketchbooks are about being a good thinker, not about being a good artist.

- Work backwards into a grid. Think about what the content requires _first_ then figure out a grid from the natural results of this process (rather than shoehorning content into a predefined grid).
- Jesse Bennett-Chamberlain’s post, [My Responsive Design Process (So Far)](http://www.31three.com/notebook/archive/my_responsive_design_process/), details his use of InDesign as a responsive design tool.
- Designing in-the-browser is more of an implementation-based thought process than designing in Photoshop. Neither process is right or wrong. _It matters when it matters._

> Let’s change the phrase “designing in the browser” to “deciding in the browser” — Dan Mall

- Prototypes can serve as documentation (Twitter Bootstrap is an example of this).
