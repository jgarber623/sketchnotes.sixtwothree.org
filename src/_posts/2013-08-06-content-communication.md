## A Framework for Collaboration

### 1. Objectives

- A concrete goal defined by personal or shared gain.
- In business, defined by customer success (external) or cost savings (internal).
- Objectives connect our work to a bottom line.
- Business objectives usually come from the top. We often have no idea _what they are_ or _what they have to do with us_.

### 2. Strategy

- A strategy statement is a rally cry for the whole team. It gives a shared, long-term direction for short-term goals and activities.

### 3. Principles

- [Government Digital Service Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples): informs every single activity that GDS performs on their website.
- Principles keep us accountable to our values, drive product and process design, and embody our way of working together.

### 4. Roles

> We should care less about specific methods and more about people on our teams. — [Pawel Brodzinski](http://brodzinski.com/2010/03/good-agile-wrong-waterfall.html)

- [The RACI Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix)
	- Who is **responsible** for a task?
	- Who is **accountable** for the work's success
	- Who must be **consulted** before work can be signed off on?
	- Who must be kept **informed** along the way?

> Activity does not always equal productivity.

### 5. Perceptions

- From Plato: You need to understand what the listener thinks, and why… then speak to that.
- Getting to a shared language means learning how to explain yourself so people can understand you. It means being brave and _asking for clarity if you need it_.
