- There are 41 imitation Apple Stores ("Apple Stoer") in Kunming, China.
- Almost as many people visited Apple Stores as visited Disney theme parks.
- Apple Stores make 2x as much per square foot as Tiffany & Co.


## Design: The Rendering of Intent

- Imitation to Innovation spectrum of intent
- Innovation is a much riskier, more expensive path than imitation.
- Companies that immitate don't value design and view products as a commodity. Companies that innovate heavily value design.

> Businesses win when they intentionally innovate and when they value designers.

Design is no longer about the visual, but about the business.


## Filling in the Gaps with Intention

- When an Apple product breaks, you take it to an Apple Store and meet with an Apple Genius.
- Apple Genius Bar appointments get around the typical retail issue of standing in line while waiting to return or exchange a defective product.

> Innovation is not adding new inventions. Innovation is adding new value.

- Experience design is rendering of intent within the gaps. (e.g. [Douglas Deitz](http://dschool.stanford.edu/student/doug-dietz/) and the Adventure Series of MRI machines)
