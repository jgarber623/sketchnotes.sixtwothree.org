- Eye tracking is being used in many industries outside of usability testing.
	- The medical industry is using eye tracking to detect autism in young children.
	- The automotive industry is using eye tracking to determine if dashboard design is safe.
	- Skiers will track their eye movement to determine opportunities for performance enhancement.
- Steve Krug's [Rocket Surgery Made Easy](http://www.sensible.com/rsme.html)
- According to Krug's book: Usability doesn't have to happen in a lab; it doesn't have to cost tens of thousands of dollars.
- **Principles:** Do it yourself. Keep an open mind. Keep it cheap. Actually watch the test. No science required.

## Eye Tracking Hardware

- In 2013, the cost of eye tracking software has dropped to commodity levels.
- [Tobii](http://www.tobii.com/) is the industry leader in eye tracking hardware. (Also the most expensive.)

- [Mirametrix](http://mirametrix.com/)
- [Gazepoint](http://gazept.com/)
- [Nuia](http://www.4tiitoo.com/) - Successfully-funded Kickstarter campaign using the Xbox Kinect

## Benefits of Eye Tracking

- Eye tracking can easily let you know which features of a site are working. For instance, the new Google Maps draws a line from a photo to the point where it appears on the map. Eye tracking tests showed this line to be very effective at getting users to interact with photos on the map.
