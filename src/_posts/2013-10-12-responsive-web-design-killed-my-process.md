title: Responsive Web Design Killed My Process
---

Presented by [Ben Callahan](http://bencallahan.com/).

> Before RWD, we pretended like things were pretty simple.

- The fixed width consensual hallucination has really constricted us.
- The linear workflow held together for quite a while. Then responsive web design came along.

> Responsive web design is about a whole lot more than layout.


## "1 Deliverable" Workflow

- Content, UX, Design, Front-End, and Back-End are all equal parts of the same pie.
- Imagine a spiral circling out from the center of the pie with touchpoints across the various disciplines at different points throughout the project timeline.


## Advancing Design through a "1 Designer" Workflow

### Establish the Aesthetic

- **Style Comparisons:** Using a tool like a Pinterest board to convey a mood, idea, or feeling. (Light or Dark? Flat or Texture? Illustration or Photography?)
- **[Style Tiles](http://styletil.es):** "mood boards for the web", used to define a visual language for the web.
- **Style Prototypes:** Taking the idea of a style tile and building it quickly in the browser. Very simple, but responsive. Using browser-based techniques can quickly bring up the conversation of browser support with a client.

> Use tools you are comfortable with to establish the aesthetic.

### Solve the Problem

- **Static Design Tools:** Photoshop, Sketch, pencil and paper
- **Responsive Design Tools:** [Adobe Edge Reflow](http://html.adobe.com/edge/reflow/), [Froont](http://froont.com/), [Macaw](http://macaw.co/)
- **HTML/CSS**
- Brad Frost's [Atomic Design](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

> We're not designing pages, we're designing systems of components — Stephen Hay

> You best solve problems using tools you are fluent with.

- **"The Dip" and the Four Stages of Learning:** Unconscious Incompetence, Conscious Incompetence, Conscious Competence, and Unconscious Competence
- The last stage, Unconscious Competence, is **fluency.** This is the level of skill we must strive for in order to solve problems in our medium.

### Refine the Solution

- Don't use static design tools during this refining period.
- Instead of doing design hand-offs, consider design pairing.
- At [Sparkbox](http://seesparkbox.com/), the Creative Director sets the creative direction for a project. Front-End Developers then work closely with the Creative Director to bring the vision to life in the browser.

> You don't want to do the long tail of refining more than once.

- Mentally switching from solving the problem to refining the solution is when you should switch to working in the browser.

> Efficiency is key when you're refining a design solution.


## Conclusion

- Establishing the problem: Comfort
- Solving the problem: Fluency
- Refining the solution: Efficiency

> Group improvisation is a challenge. Aside from the weighty technical problem of collective coherent thinking, there is the very human, even social need for sympathy from all members to bend for the common result. — Bill Evans on [_Kind of Blue_](http://www.billevanswebpages.com/kindblue.html)

> If you can't say no, it's not collaboration.

- Create guidelines instead of rigid process. The amount of process required is inversely proportional to the skill and experience of your team.

> We could create a rigid process or we could chill out and develop our people. Invest in people over process.
