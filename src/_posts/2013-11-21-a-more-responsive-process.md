The shift from responsive is akin to the shift from table-based layout to semantic markup and CSS for layout.


## The World As We Know It

- The waterfall practice was born from print design.
- We still use print design vocabulary to talk about the Web: pages, lock-up, "the fold"
- We've tried very hard to maintain the level of control we had in print design.

> We've all been willing participants in a consensual hallucination. — Jeremy Keith

- Control's not something we've been given. It's not the nature of the Web.

> The Web is not a prisoner to a single device anymore.


## A Whole New World

> Be formless. Be shapeless. Like water. — Bruce Lee

- Our job is to create solutions that are flexible and [future friendly](http://futurefriend.ly/).

### Starting with Content

- Can't really design without an understanding of the content structure and hierarchy.

> Design in the absence of content is not design, it's decoration. — Jeffrey Zeldman

### Thinking in Systems

- Get focused. Think modularly about the components that make up that system.
- Brad Frost's Atomic Design methodology

### Beyond the Box

- 1366x768 and 1920x1080 are the two most popular screen resolutions as of November, 2013.
- Those resolutions are native resolutions of high definition televisions (720p and 1080p).

> "The most popular size is every size." — Jeffrey Zeldman

### Separating Layout from Atmosphere

- Sketching is a great way to do UX, but don't focus too much on the fidelity of the sketch. Spend no more than 10-15 minutes per sketch.
- Everyone on the team can participate! Anyone can sketch and everyone should.
- **Create wireframes in the browser.** There's no substitute for the environment our work will live in.
- How do we present our aesthetic if we're not designing pages? [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es/) and similar tools can convey aesthetic without having to do full page comps.
- Mood boards are typically chaotic and unfocused. Style Tiles are ordered and focused.
- Style guides and pattern libraries follow style tiles.
- Style guides can be created in design software or the browser. Pattern libraries _can only be created in the browser_ since it should demonstrate behavior and interaction.

### Separating Content from Context

- Don't believe the "Mobile Myths" like: "Users won't want to do this on a mobile device."
- A user can be on any device at any time with any network connection under any circumstances.
- **Do not limit the content!** 85% of people expect a mobile experience to be _at least_ as good as its desktop counterpart.

### Enhancing for Feature Sets

- Experience doesn't have to be the same across every device.
- Hierarchy can change. Tools can change.
- Mobile devices have all kinds of features that desktop computers don't: touch capability, light and motion sensors, geolocation, etc.

#### Progressive Enhancement

- Design for a basic HTML document then layer on capabilities depending on the device.
- A website should work for all users regardless of their browser's capabilities.
- We should reward browsers for their capabilities rather than trying to bootstrap old, dated browsers.

### Collaboration

- The more that everyone on the team knows about the project and understands one another's roles, the better the project and process will go.
- Everyone should be aware of what everyone else on the team is working on. We work together toward a common goal.
- **Iterate!**
- No team member should ever be on their own in a silo doing their work.
- This is like Agile, but for the entire process.
- The process needs generalists that can contribute to every part of the process. You don't have to be a rockstar in every aspect of the process, but a fundamental competency in each aspect (design, development, user experience, etc.).

### Deliverables

- Take screenshots of builtout layouts if clients want "static" comps.
- Clients will love interactive wireframes!
- We can provide links to our built out style guide, to static style tile mockups, etc.
- We can (and should!) provide to the clients links to in-progress work. **Include the client/stakeholders in as much of the process as possible.**


## The Web Grows Up

- It's time we outgrow static mockups.
- Abandon your silos and collaborate!
- Let go of obsessive demand for pixel-perfection.
