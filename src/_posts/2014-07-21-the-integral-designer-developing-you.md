- [Emotional Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence) (EQ): There's more to succeeding at life than our intelligence.
- Social + Emotional Intelligence: self-awareness, social awareness, self-management, and relationship management. Each relates and impacts the other.
- [The Institute for Social and Emotional Intelligence](http://www.the-isei.com/home.aspx)
- [New Ventures West](http://www.newventureswest.com/) - coach training
- When we identify or point to "ourselves," we naturally point to our hearts.

- [Researchers Map Body Areas Linked to Specific Emotions](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201401/researchers-map-body-areas-linked-specific-emotions)
- [Neuroplasticity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity): Our brains change and we have the power to change them. We can rewire our emotions and reactions to stimuli.
