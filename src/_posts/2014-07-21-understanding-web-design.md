- When half of people don't understand what we do or why we do it, it becomes impossible to deliver good design.


## Art Directors Club

- [Stanford White](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_White) designed Madison Square Garden (and was shot and killed there). Also designed the first Art Directors Club in New York City.
- Art Directors Club helped establish design as a meaningful profession.

On flashy sites:

> Those are the kinds of sites that win awards and that nobody uses.


## Misunderstanding the Web

> Something's wrong when a web page can win awards for interactivity when the only interactive elements on the page are a "play" or "like" button.

- The awards Art Directors Club hands out have a dramatic impact on the kinds of work companies seek out. This can be incredibly dangerous when the judges don't understand the Web.
- This year's winners become next year's judges and the cycle perpetuates itself.


## The Mystery of Web Design

- Limiting the professional happiness and long-term careers of all of us.

- On in-house teams: "You gotta know what it is you're selling."
- David Siegel's original highfive.com "Excellence in Site Design." [Christopher Schmitt](http://christopherschmitt.com/) served as his intern and took over the site after David lost interest.
- [The Webby Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webby_awards) started in 1996 by Tiffany Shlain. [The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Academy_of_Digital_Arts_and_Sciences) now runs the Webbys.
- The [.net Magazine Awards](https://thenetawards.com/) are great, but are generally only paid attention to by web designers.


## The Facebook App

> On small screens or large, anything that gets in the way of the user achieving their goal is bad.

- Facebook approached mobile as a technology when it was a design problem.
- The old Facebook app's performance problems weren't a referendum on HTML5. The problem was too many developers in too many silos working on the same problem at the same time.

> How do we reduce complexity to deliver the experience the user loves about our product or site? That's what we should focus on everywhere.


## What is Web Design?

> We don't make our pages accessible or use progressive enhancement to get a gold star. We don't design for browsers or mobile devices. **We design for people.** The Web isn't technology. The Web is people.

- _Web design is like type design:_ a typeface is an environment for someone else's expression.
- _Web design is like architecture:_ people chance the meaning of architecture. The architect relinquishes control. The people who use the building change the meaning.
- A great website makes interaction easy. It guides you effortlessly toward your goal.
- Great web design can be invisible or in your face.
- Great web design _delights_. It makes you feel like you're in a place and the place is real. It's a place you want to go back to.


## Turning Colleagues into Partners

- Represent the profession. Show up on time!
- Don't wait to be invited to do your job. Nobody ever got fired for volunteering to do more work.
- Make yourself part of every important conversation at your job.
- Achieve the right things for the wrong reasons. This is okay! (see: The Cold War and the Space Race)
- Figure out what the user needs and make it about them. Empathize with the person we're working for.
