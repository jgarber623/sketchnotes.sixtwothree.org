title: Co-Design Not Redesign

Presented by [Kevin M. Hoffman](http://kevinmhoffman.com/).

- Guns n' Roses spent two weeks recording "[Appetite for Destruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetite_for_Destruction)." Axl Rose spent _ten years_ working on "[Chinese Democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_democracy)."

NIH looked at how well different teams across disciplines were collaborating. The study found that one key predictor of the success of a team regardless of size, proximity, etc.: Meetings. The more meetings they had, the better the team worked together to better results.

> People are more collaborative and innovative when they're together. – Marissa Mayer


## Collaboration

> File Sharing and Repositories **are not** collaboration.

- These systems do what email used to do a terrible job of doing and content management systems did an okay job of. They improve workflow.

> Collaboration happens when the whole is greater than the sum.

- Real-time meetings can lead to collaboration. But how do we make meetings more productive?


## Co-Design

- A means of getting everyone's perspectives out of their brains and into a design.
- Anyone adding value _is_ collaboration.


## Design the Meeting

> We designed our time together to accomplish really specific goals.

- Are decisions needed? Yes? Have a meeting! No? No meeting.
- _Only meet when a decision need to be made._
- Before the meeting, list out all the decisions that need to be made. Then, identify the owner of those decisions.

> Great meetings start with clear objectives.

- Plan meetings around decisions that need to be made, not around people.
- Drive meetings toward decision points.
- Every meeting should open with some kind of divergent thinking and close with convergent thinking.
- Brainstorming is divergent thinking without convergent thinking.

Two ways to design meetings:

1. Plan outcomes.
2. Give room for ideas to breathe.

- [Nordstrom Innovation Lab](http://nordstrominnovationlab.com/)'s [Sunglass iPad App case study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szr0ezLyQHY)


## Provide Access to the Process

- Build a working prototype to keep the client engaged throughout the design process.
- Use a facilitator to keep the meeting neutral. This person does not contribute or evaluate, but helps bring people and ideas together.
- The facilitator should have sufficient domain knowledge including technology, content, workflow, and culture. Also conducts one-on-one interviews before the meeting.

> Stop using meetings (e.g. kickoff meetings) for research.

- Stakeholder and user interviews are a great way to do research ahead of kickoff meetings. This research facilitates a productive conversation.
- [The Pen Is Mightier Than The Keyboard](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/04/22/0956797614524581.abstract) – study on the advantage of longhand notes over laptop note-taking.
- Create a visual agenda on a giant, single sheet of paper.
- Introduce **public recording** to meetings. Areas in the meeting space where sketching and other visual engagement can happen.

> Critical ideas are lost if you don't engage visually.

- Visually represent the agenda, conflicts, and key decisions. These are the visuals that get you to the testable thing.

Two ways to provide access to process:

- Neutral, informed facilitation.
- Use visuals for agendas, conflicts, decisions, and concepts.

> Be transparent about the risks we're taking and the outcomes we get from those risks.

- Haverford College's experimentation with their primary navigation. Removed "Athletics" for five days and users were able to better-find athletics-related content coming from search.

> Shorter and measurable experiments focus on results.

- It's more powerful and more influential when you share information between teams. Teams become more influential because they can help more people.

> Sharing is influence.

- [Experiment Calculator](http://www.experimentcalculator.com/) can help you figure out how to run a design experiment.

Two aspects to transparency:

- Focuses interest on the job at hand.
- Changes internal culture.


## Three Building Blocks of Co-Design

- Design meetings.
- Provide access to projects. Bring stakeholders in early before you spend too much time on anything.
- Be transparent about risks and outcomes.

> You are a guide for doing this better.
