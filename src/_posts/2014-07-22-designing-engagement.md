Presented by [Jaimee Newberry](http://www.jaimeejaimee.com/).

> Our products are the connective tissue between human beings.

- Try to capture the user's attention, affection, and devotion.


## Personality

- Ask, "_Who_ is your product?" Not, "If your product were an animal…?"
- Personality informs everything.
- Color palette, animation timing and speed, etc. all convey personality.


## Onboarding

> If you want to build affection, do onboarding really well.

- [Square](https://squareup.com/) does onboarding exceptionally well: "Start selling today."
- As does [Medium](https://medium.com/): "Your audience awaits. Tell a story on Medium today."
- Give people an opportunity to look around. Shopping sites that throw modals that require sign up or sign in before you can browse go against this. It's user-hostile behavior.
- [Jelly Defense](http://www.idreams.pl/en/our-products/show/product/14-Jelly-Defense)'s first-time play tutorials

> Empathy means everything to your products.


## Copy

- Word choice: You have to know when word choice is going to work for you and when it's not.
- Mark Trammell's and Jesse James Garrett's [Creating Engagement on Twitter](https://vimeo.com/30151867) presentation at UX Week 2011 details the tiny—but hugely impactful—change of Twitter's question: "What are you doing?" became, "What's happening?" ([see LukeW's notes](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1387))
- Use a copy framework!
- Be mindful: We have to be honest in the words that we choose.
- Review things! Make sure placeholder copy does _not_ make it to production:

- Be fun, but not scary. Be helpful, not confusing!
