- What we don't have is designers who can explain their design.

> Instincts are experiments. Data is proof.

- We're now developers of systems.
- We can't rely on designs living on their "wow" factor.
- When you're able to bring data to the argument, your points are _much_ easier to back up and meet with less resistance.
- "Data" (incorrectly) implies numbers, so "research" may be a better word for it.
- Tim Brown's [Change By Design](http://www.ideo.com/by-ideo/change-by-design)

> Get everyone on the same page, not thinking through preference. – Samantha Warren

- MailChimp [uses Evernote Business](http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2013/06/03/why-mailchimp-turns-to-evernote-business-to-get-things-done/) to get things done.

> Nobody has an excuse to make an uninformed decision anymore.

- Airbnb sends professional photographers out to photograph owern's homes to improve the quality of listings.

> [With data,] designers go from decorators to problem solvers. – Aaron Walter

## Vanity Metrics

> Beware Vanity Data! Vanity data is a piece of data upon which you cannot act.

Examples of vanity metrics:

- Hits
- Total signups
- Pageviews
- Unique visitors
- Likes

> If you can't act on a metric, it's a vanity stat.

- Track people and their habits, total number of paying customers, etc. These are the valuable pieces of data.
- Design for people!


## Common Threads

- [Blushbar](http://www.theblushbar.co.uk/): Sarah applied what she'd learned working on the web to opening a styling salon in the UK.

> Nothing has taught me more about our industry than doing something outside of it.

- Try and work outside of your comfort zone. You'll be surprised what you learn.
- Experimenting with Facebook campaigns and seeing how quickly business pickups.
- Three months from initial idea to opening the front doors.
- How do you establish personas when you have no data? Intuition!
- Using [True SocialMetrics](http://www.truesocialmetrics.com/) to keep tabs on social media traction, etc.

> Facebook posts get half their reach within 30 minutes of being posted.

- Timing is everything on Facebook.

> We need to appear to remember way more than we actually do.

- [Crazy Egg](http://www.crazyegg.com/) can create heatmaps for where on your page users are clicking.
- [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/) for user A/B testing.
- Overlay numbers on a wireframe to indicate content hierarchy which will inform reordering in a responsive design.
