- Why do we model our agencies and/or teams around the outdated assembly line process?

> We don't want web design to be a commodity, but that's what the assembly line was designed to do.


## Framework vs. Process

- A framework is not a process.
- [Newton's cradle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_cradle) is a process; it's a predictable system.
- A soccer game (or any other sportsball match) is a framework. There are rules, constraints, and guidelines that don't prohibit innovation or excitement.


## Moving from Waterfall to Agile

- Components in a waterfall process are known as swim lanes. People in a waterfall process thus exist in swim lanes, competing with one another.

> We're not set up to collaborate, but to race each other.

### 1. Passing the Baton

- Extend phases in a project so that they overlap.
- UX sticks around a little longer and designer starts a little sooner. Same with designer and developer.
- Innovation and surprise happens in the overlap.

### 2. More together time

- Extend the overlap.
- There's now a period in the project where everyone is working together. All hands on deck!

### 3. Maximum Involvement

- Extend further and you get everyone working together throughout the entire project.
- Advice: Don't bill hourly!

### 4. Appropriate Tapering

- UX Designer may be heavier up front, but tapers off later.
- Development starts slow and ramps up and is full time later on.

### 5. Focal Points

- Key moments in the project where everyone's thinking together (e.g. kickoff, launch), then everyone breaks off into their own disciplines or concerns.
- Work will converge at points throughout the project.
- Periods of divergent thinking and effort and convergent thinking and effort throughout a project timeline.

### 6. Rinse & Repeat

- Repeat the above process in phases, repeating as many times as necessary to get from beginning to finished project.

> Start and ship. Start and ship. Start and ship.

- Get all team members involved in writing creative briefs and other documents.


## Modern Web Design Process

### 1. Plan

- Research!
- In a recent project (a magazine redesign), Dan worked with Jennifer Brooks and they created a document, Themes & Insights, based on their research.

> Here's a bunch of things we found. Let's talk about them.

- Research revealed that end users wanted to know what products they should buy. That opened up the door to really interesting advertising that could be done in a non-sleazy way.

### 2. Inventory

#### Content Inventory

- The SuperFriend Model: No employees, everyone's a partner. Team members are drafted based on the needs of the project.
- Adaptive Path's [content inventory process](http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/doing-content-inventory/)
- For every page on the site, pick whether it should be added to, edited, or removed.

#### Performance Budget

- A way to describe how fast a page should load by giving it a budget.
- Treat technical decisions as financial decisions: "We want this page to load in 2 seconds with fewer than 30 HTTP requests."
- [RadioFreeEurope RadioLiberty open redesign](http://danielmall.com/articles/radio-free-europe-open-redesign/)
- [RFERL's redesign blog](http://responsivedesign.rferl.org/)
- Using [WebPagetest](http://www.webpagetest.org/) to analyze competitor's website performance

> You have to be at least 20% faster to be perceived as being faster than a competitor's site.

- That 20% faster is your target when looking at competitors.

#### Pattern Lab

- Allows you to break design elements down into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, then pages.
- Have a discussion with the client around the various pieces (atoms, molecules, etc.) before designing anything in Photoshop or building in the browser.
- Not all clients are savvy enough to work with a system like Pattern Lab.

> Do the least amount of work with the highest fidelity to get to the conversation points faster.

#### Visual Inventory

- "Is showing the app on a laptop on the homepage the best way to sell it to prospective customers?" Just because everyone else does it, does that work for this client or product?
- Dan starts projects in Keynote by making a visual inventory.
- Take a screenshot of a sample website and add a caption asking questions: "How playful and whimsical should the new site be? Here's an example of playful and whimsical." Replace the logo with the client's logo.

> Anything I'm wondering about, I find a site that behaves that way and present it to the client and ask, "Is this what you want to do?"

### 3. Sketch

- Exploring ideas as roughly and quickly as possible.
- Stephen Hay's [Responsive Design Workflow](http://responsivedesignworkflow.com/)
- Linear Design: list out everything on a page, make them grey boxes, and roughly the size they should be.

> Conversations—not deliverables—are what solve problems

- It's easy to make grey boxes responsive. Make that and talk about that.
- [Grantland](http://grantland.com/)'s interactive wireframes to discuss hierarchy and importance. Wireframe code ended up being used in production code. This work _could_ be throwaway, but doesn't have to be.

#### Element Collages

> When you listen hard enough, clients will tell you about their brand.

- Regarding soliciting donations on the [Reading Is Fundamental](http://www.rif.org/) redesign:

> If you suggest something to a customer, their 80% more likely to do it.

> The client will tell you what to design if you listen hard enough.

- "Obviously this isn't a website, but I see how it could be one." — The perfect client's reaction to an element collage.
- Content of an element collage varies greatly depending on the kind of project: typography for Techcrunch, for instance.
- Showing states of things (e.g. in-action button hover states) helps a client realize that an element collage is not an actual website.
- Showing people holding tablets or phones in an element collage reinforces the "not an actual website" notion.
- Clearleft experimented with [horizontally-oriented element collages](http://clearleft.com/thinks/visualdesignexplorations/).

> Element collages are like giving your client a peek at all those hidden layers. – Paul Robert Lloyd

#### Prototypes

- Problem and Solution Statements: Build a prototype that solves one and only one thing. Then move on to the next thing.

### 4. Assemble

- _Mise en place_, everything in its place.
- "Presets" are combinations of organisms. A different word for "template" since that's such a loaded term.
- Akin to [VSCO CAM](http://vsco.co/vscocam)'s filters: pick a filter, but then modify its intensity.


## RWD as a Catalyst

- We're not just talking about flexible images, media queries, etc. We're talking about everything: content, performance, accessibility, organizational change, workflow.
- RWD is a reminder of what's important and we need a better framework for talking about this.
