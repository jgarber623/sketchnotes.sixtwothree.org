title: "The Art of Anticipation"
---

Presented by [Derek Featherstone](http://simplyaccessible.com/).

- How do we use anticipation to create moments of joy and excitement?
- It's natural to get sucked into thinking that design is about the device.

> The device is one piece of context.

- Time, location, proximity, the device itself, the user's state of mind and capabilitiesâ€¦ These are all pieces of what defines, "context."
- We no longer ask what resolution we design for, we ask what resolution _ranges_ we should design for.
- For the [UXCamp Ottawa site](http://uxcampottawa.org/), on the day of the event, flip the homepage to show the event's schedule.
- The team created a context map that plots content importance over time.
- Content hierarchy based on a user's location: How does your content's priority change with respect to a user's locadtion?
- [Dopplr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopplr) silently switched the calendar widget's first day of the week based on user's location (Sunday for the US, Monday for most everywhere else).
- All saved context must be resettable!

> Context changes with respect to proximity. Where are you in relation to another person, place, or thing?

- GPS adjusts the zoom of a map depending on your speed, showing more of the map at higher speeds.
- Display should change with regards to capabilities, expressed interests, etc.

> If a user has said something is important to them, then we should provide that kind of information as quickly as possible.

- **Minimum Viable Interaction:** what is the absolute minimum that someone needs to make a decision as to whether or not they should go further with a particular piece of information?
- What if someone only consumes your site by reading/hearing the headings? Can they use your site?
- Could displays change with respect to state of mind?

> Remember the device is just one piece of context. We want to use time, location, proximity, device, state of mind, capabilities, etc.

> Content in context is king.
