Presented by [Moldover](http://moldover.com/).

- The "Checking Email Aesthetic" in electronic music performance.
- Computer interfaces (keyboard, mouse) are very limited as it relates to their expressivity. Compare that to musical interfaces like guitars, etc.
- Built a controller interface to Ableton that is incredibly rugged yet easily repairable. It's also designed to be ergonomic and easy to "play."
