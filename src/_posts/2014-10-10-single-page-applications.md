- The biggest benefit has to do with user experience.
- Single-page applications (SPAs) are supposed to provide an "app-like experience."

## Users respond to speed

- A half second caused a 20% drop in Google's traffic on search result pages.
- For Amazon, a 100 millisecond delay caused a "substantial and costly drop in revenue."
- Shopzilla redesigned, focusing on page load time, and saw a 25% increase in page views and a 7-12% increase in revenue.

## Latency

- SPAs improve latency by offsetting server work to the client (the browser).
- SPAs selectively load page fragments.
- Use `localStorage` to remember user actions.
- Reduces load time by using templates.
- Uses AJAX for tasks.
